I am a person defined in the professional world as someone with a great capacity to adapt to different roles. With my 25 years of age, I feel that every day is a day to try different things, such as new roles, new challenges or new horizons that I could take thanks to technology.

I graduated as a Computer Engineer in 2018, where I had the opportunity to find a job where I began to learn about the realities in the professional world.
I can proudly say that I have 2 years of experience (counted since I wrote this biography haha) in the world of work, which has given me important values ​​regarding how committed I can be to my work. I like being part of communities around the world, with the aim of learning new cultures, knowledge and experiences from other people and professionals.

I can say that one of the great virtues that I feel I have is commitment, loyalty, and listening to others always wanting to learn from each one of them. I hope that is my greatest legacy at a professional level.
